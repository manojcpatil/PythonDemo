    "# SQL Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this SQL tutorial, you’ll learn all the basic to advanced SQL concepts like SQL queries, SQL join, SQL injection, SQL insert, and creating tables in SQL. SQL is easy to learn, there are no prerequisites to learning SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, SQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.\n",

    "# What is a Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand what a database is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, data is the new fuel of this world, but data is unorganized information, so to organize that data, we make a database. A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this SQL tutorial for beginners, we’ll explore practical SQL examples for managing employee data within a database. We’ll create a table to store employee information and populate it with sample data like Employee_Id, Name, Age, Department, and Salary.\n",

    "The `sqlite3` module in Python provides a straightforward and easy-to-use interface for working with SQLite databases. Here's a brief introduction to its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Establishment**: The `sqlite3.connect()` function is used to establish a connection to an SQLite database file. If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cursor Creation**: After establishing a connection, you create a cursor object using the `connection.cursor()` method. The cursor is used to execute SQL commands and interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL Execution**: The cursor's `execute()` method is used to execute SQL commands such as creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`), inserting data (`INSERT INTO`), updating records (`UPDATE`), deleting records (`DELETE`), and querying data (`SELECT`). You can also use `executemany()` to execute multiple SQL commands with varying parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transaction Management**: SQLite transactions are managed implicitly by default, but you can manually commit changes to the database using the `connection.commit()` method. Similarly, you can roll back changes using `connection.rollback()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**: The `sqlite3` module provides mechanisms for handling errors that may occur during database operations. You can use try-except blocks to catch exceptions raised by SQLite operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Connection Closure**: It's important to close the database connection when you're done working with it to release system resources. You can close the connection using the `connection.close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `sqlite3` module simplifies interaction with SQLite databases in Python, making it easy to create, read, update, and delete data, as well as manage transactions and handle errors. It's particularly useful for small to medium-sized databases or when you need a lightweight and self-contained database solution."
