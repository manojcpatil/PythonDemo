SymPy offers a wide range of functions for symbolic mathematics, including algebraic manipulations, calculus, solving equations, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and more. Below is a list of some common SymPy functions along with their syntaxes and brief descriptions of their applications:

1. **Symbols**: 
   - Syntax: `Symbol('x')` or `symbols('x y z')`
   - Description: Defines symbolic variables.
   - Example Application: Used to define variables for symbolic expressions.

2. **Simplify**:
   - Syntax: `simplify(expression)`
   - Description: Simplifies an expression.
   - Example Application: Simplifying complicated mathematical expressions.

Here's an example of how you can use the `simplify` function in SymPy to simplify a complicated mathematical expression:

```python
from sympy import simplify, symbols

# Define symbolic variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define a complicated expression
expression = (x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2) / (x**2 - y**2)

# Simplify the expression
simplified_expression = simplify(expression)

print("Original Expression:", expression)
print("Simplified Expression:", simplified_expression)
```

Output:
```
Original Expression: (x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2)/(x**2 - y**2)
Simplified Expression: (x + y)/(x - y)
```

In this example, the `simplify` function is used to simplify the expression `(x**2 + 2*x*y + y**2) / (x**2 - y**2)`, which is a rational expression. The simplified expression `(x + y)/(x - y)` is obtained by canceling common terms in the numerator and denominator.


3. **Expand**:
   - Syntax: `expand(expression)`
   - Description: Expands a polynomial expression.
   - Example Application: Expanding algebraic expressions.

4. **Factor**:
   - Syntax: `factor(expression)`
   - Description: Factors a polynomial expression.
   - Example Application: Factoring algebraic expressions.

5. **Derivative**:
   - Syntax: `diff(expression, variable)`
   - Description: Computes the derivative of an expression.
   - Example Application: Calculating derivatives in calculus.

6. **Integral**:
   - Syntax: `integrate(expression, variable)`
   - Description: Computes the indefinite integral of an expression.
   - Example Application: Solving indefinite integrals in calculus.

7. **Limits**:
   - Syntax: `limit(expression, variable, value)`
   - Description: Computes the limit of an expression as a variable approaches a certain value.
   - Example Application: Evaluating limits in calculus.

8. **Solve**:
   - Syntax: `solve(equation, variable)`
   - Description: Solves algebraic equations symbolically.
   - Example Application: Finding solutions to equations.

9. **Matrix**:
   - Syntax: `Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`
   - Description: Creates a symbolic matrix.
   - Example Application: Working with matrices and linear algebra.

10. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
    - Syntax: `eigenvals(matrix)` and `eigenvects(matrix)`
    - Description: Computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
    - Example Application: Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors in linear algebra.

These are just a few examples of the many functions available in SymPy. SymPy's documentation provides comprehensive information about all available functions and their usage.
