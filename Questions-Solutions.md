# Graph Plotting

1.  **Linear Function Plotter:**\
    Write a Python program that takes the coefficients of a linear
    function (e.g., $y = mx + b$) as input and plots the corresponding
    graph using Matplotlib.

2.  **Quadratic Function Animation:**\
    Create an animated plot that shows the changing graph of a quadratic
    function (e.g., $y = ax^2 + bx + c$) as the coefficients vary. Allow
    users to interactively adjust the coefficients.

3.  **Function Composition:**\
    Implement a program that combines a linear and a quadratic function
    into a single plot. Allow users to choose the coefficients and
    visualize the resulting graph.

4.  **Customized Plot Styling:**\
    Develop a Python script that demonstrates advanced customization of
    Matplotlib plots. Include features such as different line styles,
    colors, and markers. Apply these to the linear, quadratic, and
    exponential functions.

5.  **Multiple Function Plots:**\
    Create a program that plots multiple functions on the same graph.
    Allow users to input multiple functions and display them with
    distinct colors and labels.

6.  **Interactive Exponential Function:**\
    Build an interactive plot for the exponential function where users
    can input a range for $x$ values, and the plot updates dynamically.
    Include axis labels, a legend, and a title.

7.  **Polynomial Function Plotter:**\
    Develop a versatile Python tool that can plot polynomials of any
    degree. Allow users to input coefficients, specify the degree, and
    visualize the resulting polynomial graph.

8.  **Logarithmic Scale Plot:**\
    Modify the exponential function plot to be displayed on a
    logarithmic scale. Demonstrate how to set up logarithmic axes using
    Matplotlib.

9.  **Function Derivative Visualization:**\
    Extend the linear function plot program to also display the
    derivative of the function. Use numerical differentiation to
    calculate the derivative.

10. **Error Handling in Plotting:**\
    Implement a robust Python script that handles potential errors in
    user input for function coefficients. Provide informative error
    messages and guide the user to correct any mistakes.

# Data Visualization

1.  Line Plot with Multiple Lines Modify the line plot example to
    include two or more lines with different colors and styles.

2.  Customizing Scatter Plot Create a scatter plot with random data and
    customize it by adding a title, labels, and changing the marker
    style.

3.  Grouped Bar Chart Extend the bar chart example to create a grouped
    bar chart with multiple categories and compare values.

4.  Box Plot with Seaborn Use Seaborn to create a box plot with a
    dataset of your choice, and customize it with appropriate labels and
    titles.

5.  Kernel Density Estimation Plot Experiment with different datasets
    and create a distribution plot using kernel density estimation with
    Seaborn.

6.  Enhanced Pair Plot Improve the pair plot example by customizing the
    appearance, adding labels, and highlighting different classes.

# Dictionary and Sorting, Minimum and Maximum

1.  **Accessing Dictionary Values:** Create a dictionary representing a
    product with attributes like name, price, and quantity. Allow the
    user to input the product name and display its details.

2.  **Sorting by Keys:** Given a dictionary with random key-value pairs,
    write a function to sort the dictionary based on keys and print the
    sorted result.

3.  **Sorting by Values:** Write a Python program to sort a dictionary
    based on values in descending order. Display the sorted dictionary.

4.  **Minimum and Maximum Keys:** Create a dictionary with keys as years
    (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022) and values as some data. Find and display
    the minimum and maximum years.

5.  **Minimum and Maximum Values:** Develop a program that defines a
    dictionary representing temperatures in Celsius for different days.
    Find and print the day with the minimum and maximum temperature.

6.  **Nested Dictionaries:** Extend the student dictionary example to
    include nested dictionaries for each student, representing their
    courses and corresponding grades.

7.  **Filtering Dictionary:** Given a dictionary of product prices,
    write a function to filter out products with prices below a certain
    threshold. Display the filtered dictionary.

8.  **Updating Dictionary:** Implement a program where the user can
    update the details of a student in the dictionary (e.g., change the
    grade or age).

9.  **Dictionary Operations:** Write a Python program that performs
    various operations on dictionaries, such as merging two
    dictionaries, removing a key-value pair, and clearing the entire
    dictionary.
