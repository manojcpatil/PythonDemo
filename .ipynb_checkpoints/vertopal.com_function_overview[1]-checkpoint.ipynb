    "Most of your interactions with seaborn will happen through a set of\n",
    "plotting functions. Later chapters in the tutorial will explore the\n",
    "specific features offered by each function. This chapter will introduce,\n",
    "at a high-level, the different kinds of functions that you will\n",
    "encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similar functions for similar tasks<a href=\"#similar-functions-for-similar-tasks\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The seaborn namespace is flat; all of the functionality is accessible at\n",
    "the top level. But the code itself is hierarchically structured, with\n",
    "modules of functions that achieve similar visualization goals through\n",
    "different means. Most of the docs are structured around these modules:\n",
    "you’ll encounter names like “relational”, “distributional”, and\n",
    "“categorical”.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the\n",
    "<a href=\"../api.html#distribution-api\" class=\"reference internal\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">distributions module</span></a>\n",
    "defines functions that specialize in representing the distribution of\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_3\\_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with similar, but perhaps less familiar, options such as kernel\n",

    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_5\\_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions within a module share a lot of underlying code and offer\n",
    "similar features that may not be present in other components of the\n",
    "library (such as `multiple=\"stack\"` in the examples above). They are\n",
    "designed to facilitate switching between different visual\n",
    "representations as you explore a dataset, because different\n",
    "representations often have complementary strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Figure-level vs. axes-level functions<a href=\"#figure-level-vs-axes-level-functions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the different modules, there is a cross-cutting\n",
    "classification of seaborn functions as “axes-level” or “figure-level”.\n",
    "The examples above are axes-level functions. They plot data onto a\n",
    "single `matplotlib.pyplot.Axes` object, which is the return value of the\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, figure-level functions interface with matplotlib through a\n",

    "<a href=\"../generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html#seaborn.FacetGrid\" class=\"reference internal\" title=\"seaborn.FacetGrid\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">FacetGrid</code></a>,\n",
    "that manages the figure. Each module has a single figure-level function,\n",
    "which offers a unitary interface to its various axes-level functions.\n",
    "The organization looks a bit like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_8\\_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "<a href=\"../generated/seaborn.displot.html#seaborn.displot\" class=\"reference internal\" title=\"seaborn.displot\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">displot()</code></a>\n",
    "is the figure-level function for the distributions module. Its default\n",
    "behavior is to draw a histogram, using the same code as\n",
    "<a href=\"../generated/seaborn.histplot.html#seaborn.histplot\" class=\"reference internal\" title=\"seaborn.histplot\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">histplot()</code></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "You’ll notice that the figure-level plots look mostly like their\n",
    "axes-level counterparts, but there are a few differences. Notably, the\n",
    "legend is placed ouside the plot. They also have a slightly different\n",
    "shape (more on that shortly).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful feature offered by the figure-level functions is that\n",
    "they can easily create figures with multiple subplots. For example,\n",
    "instead of stacking the three distributions for each species of penguins\n",
    "in the same axes, we can “facet” them by plotting each distribution\n",
    "across the columns of the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sns.displot(data=penguins, x=\"flipper_length_mm\", hue=\"species\", col=\"species\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_14_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure-level functions wrap their axes-level counterparts and pass\n",
    "the kind-specific keyword arguments (such as the bin size for a\n",
    "histogram) down to the underlying function. That means they are no less\n",
    "flexible, but there is a downside: the kind-specific parameters don’t\n",
    "appear in the function signature or docstrings. Some of their features\n",
    "might be less discoverable, and you may need to look at two different\n",
    "pages of the documentation before understanding how to achieve a\n",
    "specific goal.\n",

    "### Axes-level functions make self-contained plots<a href=\"#axes-level-functions-make-self-contained-plots\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The axes-level functions are written to act like drop-in replacements\n",
    "for matplotlib functions. While they add axis labels and legends\n",
    "automatically, they don’t modify anything beyond the axes that they are\n",

    "internally, which hooks into the matplotlib state-machine interface so\n",
    "that they draw their plots on the “currently-active” axes. But they\n",

    "\n",
    "In contrast, figure-level functions cannot (easily) be composed with\n",
    "other plots. By design, they “own” their own figure, including its\n",
    "initialization, so there’s no notion of using a figure-level function to\n",
    "draw a plot onto an existing axes. This constraint allows the\n",
    "figure-level functions to implement features such as putting the legend\n",
    "outside of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is possible to go beyond what the figure-level\n",

    "### Specifying figure sizes<a href=\"#specifying-figure-sizes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a>\n",

    "while setting up the plot (e.g. with the `figsize` parameter of\n",

    "or by calling a method on the figure object (e.g.\n",
    "`matplotlib.Figure.set_size_inches()`). When using an axes-level\n",
    "function in seaborn, the same rules apply: the size of the plot is\n",
    "determined by the size of the figure it is part of and the axes layout\n",
    "in that figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a figure-level function, there are several key differences.\n",
    "First, the functions themselves have parameters to control the figure\n",
    "size (although these are actually parameters of the underlying\n",
    "<a href=\"../generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html#seaborn.FacetGrid\" class=\"reference internal\" title=\"seaborn.FacetGrid\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">FacetGrid</code></a>\n",
    "that manages the figure). Second, these parameters, `height` and\n",
    "`aspect`, parameterize the size slightly differently than the `width`,\n",
    "`height` parameterization in matplotlib (using the seaborn parameters,\n",
    "`width = height * apsect`). Most importantly, the parameters correspond\n",
    "to the size of each *subplot*, rather than the size of the overall\n",
    "figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between these approaches, here is the\n",
    "default output of\n",
    "<a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots\" class=\"reference external\" title=\"(in Matplotlib v3.4.3)\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">matplotlib.pyplot.subplots()</code></a>\n",
    "with one subplot:\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_24_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "A figure with multiple columns will have the same overall size, but the\n",
    "axes will be squeezed horizontally to fit in the space:\n",

    "    f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_26_0.png</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a plot created by a figure-level function will be square.\n",
    "To demonstrate that, let’s set up an empty plot by using\n",
    "<a href=\"../generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html#seaborn.FacetGrid\" class=\"reference internal\" title=\"seaborn.FacetGrid\"><code class=\"sourceCode python\">FacetGrid</code></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"image\">../\\_images/function_overview_30_0.png</span>\n",
